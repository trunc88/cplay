Description
-----------

``cplay`` is a minimalist music player with a textual user interface
written in Python. It aims to provide a power-user-friendly interface
with simple file list and playlist control.
Instead of building an elaborate database of your music library,
``cplay`` allows you to quickly browse the filesystem and enqueue
directories. Cue-files and other playlists are supported.

The original cplay was started by Ulf Betlehem in 1998 and is no longer
maintained. This is a fork that keeps the original design as much as possible.
For a rewrite, see https://github.com/xi/cplay-ng

- volume control: `alsaaudio <http://pyalsaaudio.sourceforge.net/>`_,
  ``pulseaudio-utils`` (specifically the ``pactl`` command),
  OSS support is part of the standard library.
- detect character encodings of playlists:
  `python-magic <https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic>`_

Installation
------------

::

    $ make install

In Debian/Ubuntu, the following installs a selection of players and optional components::

    $ sudo apt-get install mplayer gst123 mpg321 vorbis-tools python-alsaaudio pulseaudio-utils python-magic

Usage
-----

::

    $ cplay [-nrRv] [ file | dir | playlist ] ...

When in doubt, press ``h`` for a friendly help page.

Configuration
-------------

If you would like to change the default player or the options passed to the
players just edit the ``PLAYERS`` list at the end of the cplay script.

Miscellaneous
-------------

A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will have to be
local. For mpeg streaming, ``splay`` is recommended.

It is also possible to pipe a playlist to ``cplay``, as stdin will be
reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

Remote control via ``/tmp/cplay-control-$USER`` -- refer to the class
``FIFOControl`` for the list of recognized commands.
